                            If you have given consent to data processing, we process your personal data 
                            on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR if special categories 
                            of data are processed. In case of explicit consent to transfer personal data 
                            to third countries, processing also takes place according to Art. 49(1)(a) GDPR. 
                            If the storage of cookies or device access has been consented to, processing is 
                            additionally based on ยง25(1) TTDSG. Consent can be revoked at any time.

                            You can revoke a given consent at any time.

                            or the processing serves the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.

                            this will only take place if it is technically feasible.
