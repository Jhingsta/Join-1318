# Project: Join

## Description

As part of our training at the **Developer Academy**, we are developing a web app using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Git**, and **Firebase**.  
The goal of this project is to build a **project management tool** that visualizes the status and responsibilities of tasks.

We are using **Join Version 2** as the design template, and an **FTP server** for live demos.
